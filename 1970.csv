There were four bullets in the gun, but none in the firing chamber and Fromme was seized by two Secret Service agents immediately after brandishing her weapon.  Fromme maintained that she did not want to shoot the President and has given conflicting reports describing her motivations.  She has stated that she used the incident to bring attention to the unfair conviction of Charles Manson, and three others for the 1969 Tate-Labianca murders.  However, on other occasions Fromme stated that she pointed a gun at President Ford to raise the awareness of various environmental causes.",0,0,Assassination,Government (General),Supporters of Charles Manson,Reports of the motivations for this incident vary from bringing attention to the 'unfair' imprisonment of Charles Manson and his cohorts to trying to raise awareness of environmental issues such as the plight of the California Redwoods and the dangers of nuclear power.,1,1,1,Firearms,0,0,0,0,0,0

The FBI office on the sixth floor of the building was not damaged, but the drugstore that occupied the ground floor was damaged. Additionally, one passerby was cut on the arm by a shard of flying glass from the explosion. This incident occurred in conjunction with the bombing of the American Bank Note currency printing plant in the Bronx, also claimed by FALN on this day (197703210004).",1,0,Bombing/Explosion,Government (General),Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional (FALN),"In the note left by FALN at a telephone booth by the FBI building, members demanded that officials cease the federal investigation of two women lay ministers of the Episcopal Church, who worked for the National Commission on Hispanic Affairs.  FBI officials believed the women had information about the only known member of FALN, Carlos Albert Torres, and were thus imprisoned on charges of contempt, despite their denials of any knowledge of FALN or the activities of FALN members.",0,-99,-99,Explosives,,,,1,1,1

They then took 30 people hostage and barricaded themselves in the kitchen of the hotel.  After negotiating with authorities, they released 12 hostages under the condition that the two shooters and the remaining hostages be allowed to travel to Larnaca Airport.  At the airport, the gunmen boarded a plane, along with 11 hostages and 4 volunteers from the flight crew.  Once in the air, the gunmen requested to land in Libya, Kuwait, Somalia, Greece and Sothern Yemen.  All 5 denied them permission to land.  The plane eventually landed in Djibouti and refueled.  After refueling the plane was forced to return to Larnaca Airport.  At the airport a gun fight erupted involving the Greek Cypriot National Guard and Egyptian commandos while both groups were attempting to rescue the hostages.  15 Egyptians were killed.  Eventually, the gunmen released all remaining hostages and surrender to the National Guard.  The gunmen claimed they assassinated Yousef Sebai because he had published pro-Israel articles and they were supporting the Palestinian cause.",1,0,Assassination,Journalists & Media,Anti-Israeli extremists,In protest of pro-Israel articles in the Egyptian newspaper edited by Mr. Sebai.,1,2,2,Firearms,16,0,0,,0,0

Cikoja was on his way to his own car, when he collapsed on the front stoop.  Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident because Cikoja had received a threat letter , three months prior to his murder, from a group calling itself the ""Croatian Nationalist Army"", demanding that he pay $5,000 by August towards the group's cause for independence, or otherwise he would be killed. He refused to pay the money.

Ryan had initially gone to Guyana to investigate abuses of members of the Peoples Temple, founded by Reverend Jim Jones. After being threatened with a knife by one of the members, Ryan decided to cut his visit short. As he was boarding an aircraft to leave, reports claim that between 8 and 12 members of the cult were responsible for firing approximately 50 shots. The shots killed three American investigators traveling with Jones, as well as an 18-year-old American woman who was trying to leave. Larry John Leyton, a man posing as a defector, was the only person charged in America for involvement in the murder. Jones organized the murder of Ryan and members of his party in order to keep them from revealing the true conditions at Jonestown.",1,0,Assassination,Government (General),People's Temple,Jones murder conspiracy was carried out in order to keep Ryan and those traveling with him from reporting the truth about conditions at Jonestown.,0,8,9,Firearms,5,5,0,0,9,0

Whitfield survived and was treated for his wounds.  The Ku Klux Klan claimed responsibility for the attack and stated that Whitfield had no business being in Alabama and that the beating will teach him to stay out; the motive was that Whitfield had denounced the rape conviction of black man Tommy Lee Hines, for raping a white woman.  Earlier this day, Whitfield preached for three hours on the steps of the Cullman County courthouse, at which time he denounced the conviction, and was taunted by whites. Whitfield initially refused to press charges against the perpetrators, but then later agreed to testify before a Federal grand jury.",1,0,Hostage Taking (Kidnapping),Religious Figures/Institutions,Ku Klux Klan,"The Ku Klux Klan  stated that Whitfield had no business being in Alabama and that the beating will teach him to stay out; the motive was that Whitfield had denounced the rape conviction of black man Tommy Lee Hines, for raping a white woman.",0,3,-99,Melee,0,0,0,1,1,0

The bomb was sent in a book, mailed to Reverend Timothy Majic, a Roman Catholic pastor of Sacred Heart Church, who also worked as an editor for the Morning Star, a Croatian-language newspaper published in Chicago. In the book, there were three batteries and what appeared to be dynamite in a hollowed out section.  While disarming the device, detective George Timm lost part of his right index finger, and suffered cuts on his hand, face, and chest. Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident.",1,0,Bombing/Explosion,Religious Figures/Institutions,Croatian Nationalists,"The specific motive is unknown; however, it is suspected that the reason for the bomb was because the intended target, Timothy Majic, had been writing for a Croatian-language newspaper.",0,-99,-99,Explosives,0,0,0,1,1,0

The march was in support of a mentally disabled black man who was charged with raping a white woman, and convicted by an all-white jury.  During the march, Klansmen blocked the street, disobeyed police orders to allow the marchers to pass, and opened gunfire, injuring two black marchers and five law enforcements officials.  Two Klansmen were also shot and wounded. In May 1984, ten Klansmen were charged in federal court for civil rights violations in a violent disruption of black marchers and police, and nine of the men were charged with the conspiracy of use of force or threat of force for purposes of intimidating parade participants because of their race. By January 1989, all ten Klan members had either been found guilty or pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them in this incident.",1,0,Armed Assault,Private Citizens & Property,Ku Klux Klan,"The Klansmen intentionally intended to interrupt the march due to the fact that the marchers were protesting the conviction, by an all-white jury, of a mentally disabled black man for the rape of a white woman.",0,10,10,Firearms,0,0,0,9,7,2

He also stated that a message was left in a locker at the terminal at 421 Grand Central Station.  The message was written in Croatian and listed a series of demands that the group asked be aired on television and radio between 6pm and 7pm that evening, otherwise 2 more bombs, which were placed in congested areas, would be detonated at 8:30pm that evening.
